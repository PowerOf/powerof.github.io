This project is being used as my project portfolio website.

It is based on a fork of Flexible-Jekyll theme by Artem Sheludko.
I take no credit for the theme itself, although I made some changes to fit better with the goals of this project.

Changes included but not limited to:
- a more consistent scaling across different resolutions
- only included links to professional contact details
- added support for spoiler tags
