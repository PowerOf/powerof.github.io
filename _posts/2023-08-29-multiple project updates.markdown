# Multiple project updates

### Current projects:

##### Project A: Portfolio Website

State: Website is functional but needs a few more things. I need to find ways to showcase my projects better. Also need to upload some various pictures to be a bit more interesting.

##### Project B: Mental Health Guardian / Reddit content filter

State: In progress, no more updates. I had some ideas but it's a lot of work and I was focusing on the other projects last week.
The first milestone has been reached and the prototype works well on a manual basis, for a single website.

##### Project C: Java project with Cypress tests

State: In progress, 1st milestone completed. In the interest of finding QA work, I had taken a fork of a Java project and added Cypress tests to it. There's more that should be done as the second part will be API tests, but we are off to a good start.
I need to add the project to the portfolio page and

##### Project D: Chrome Extension Game Performance Predictor

State: In planning phase, requirements and architecture planning. This will be a small extension either part of the Augmented Steam extension, or a standalone extension. The current use case is you have some kind of a computer, and this extension can give you a rough estimate of how well a game will run if installed.

##### Project E: Chrome Right click bookmark Extension

State: In progress, advanced stage. Use case: I wanted this forever. Started work today and already made a lot of progress.

##### Project F: Playwright test project

State: Not started yet. I need to put some time into being familiar with Playwright and how it works. This seems to be industry standard technology so I should be familiar with it.

##### Project G: Youtube channel and Patreon.

State: Idea stage Not much to say here, I might be looking at these to support my efforts to develop the projects. Youtube could be whatever I enjoy or can make a video about it, but the problem is I am not proficient nor efficient enough and making any sort of videos, In regards to patreon that would be one way to gather support but also let people start to use prototypes and gather feedback on them. Since I don't have a community yet, I need to be looking at ways to connect with people. And I could get in touch with different people to see if they would like to team up to make a development team/company.
