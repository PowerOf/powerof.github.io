Project C

Today we are working on looking at implementing automated tests for a Java-based project.

We need 2 things for this: The project itself, and example tests that we are doing.

We are looking for a quick setup and a wide, standard coverage for UI and potentially API side. Tests should reside in the same repository as the App.
