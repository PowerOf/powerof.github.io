# Mid-September round of updates

I think doing a detailed post once a month is good. If there are more updates I can share it within smaller, more focused posts.

## Current projects:

### Project A: Portfolio Website

- State: Website is functional but needs a few more things. I need to find ways to showcase my projects better. Also need to upload some various pictures to be a bit more interesting.

### Project B: Mental Health Guardian / Reddit content filter

- State: In progress, 1st milestone completed. A small update is that I've been looking into youtube and the way the page works. That's all for now.

### Project C: Java project with Cypress tests

- State: In progress, 1st milestone completed.
- [Repo](https://github.com/PowerOf/spring-petclinic-fork)
- Planned:
  - Playwright tests
  - Continuous integration

### Project D: Chrome Extension Game Performance Predictor

- State: In planning phase. No new updates.

### Project E: Chrome Right click bookmark Extension

- State: In progress, Released
- I've released this on Github at the current state. With a little more work, this can be improved and be more usable.

### Project F: ChatGPT widescreen fix
- State: Released. I've done this today, it's a really small project and I will probably take it down from this list at one point. 
- [Repo](https://github.com/PowerOf/chrome-2k-scaling-chatgpt-extension)
   - If we were to do Chatgpt enhancements, I would be looking at adding a search box to find conversations across your history with chatgpt. I have probably over 100 convos at this point and a lot of the time I need to look up past information and it's difficult when you could have talked about it in just a small snippet hidden somewhere.
   - I dislike how much of the site is just so crude.
     - personal setting only works somewhat
     - Plugins were hidden so well that I could not even find them for a long time.
     - Plugins list is just awful to look at. 300 pages to scroll through one by one. No marketplace or anything. No themes, no search again. Bleugh
     - There should be some way to remember past convos. Otherwise it's difficult to use
     - No starring convos
     - No saved themes or save/load settings, nothing

### Project Y and Project P: Youtube and Patreon
- State: No updates, aside from getting their own letters. It is on the cards though.

## New projects!

### Project V: Voice Buddy extension
- State: In progress. This will be a ChatGPT implementation that you can actually talk to and it will respond back in either text or it's own voice. The main use case is to have someone  to talk to when you need it. 
This will be available on phone as an app but for now we are starting with a chrome extension.

### Project L: LinkedIn enhancements
- State: In planning phase.
- As usual, I have some bad experience online and then I just research ways to change how the site functions and change it to something that I prefer. In this case, LinkedIn intentionally starts every time with the 'top' posts on your feed, we would like to change this to 'Recents' and for it to stay that way.
I would like to say that this should not take long, but will just have to see.

### Project T: Twitter enhancements
- State: In planning/research phase
- So My twitter downloader extension broke today. So As usual, I have decided to take matters into my own hands. Coincidentally, the terms of use have also changed today, but it should only apply to bots and not users that manually download posts that they like to their own machine.
A few more things that I'd like to do:
  - mute all videos by default,
  - replace the sound of videos to something soothing when you're watching it.
  - integrate with the AI toxicity filter (Project B) so it would prevent you from seeing things that could upset you. Political activism or shouty disco murder posts are might not be what you want to see first thing in the morning
  - I also would like to have an animation blocker that would stop autoplaying everything the second you scroll over it. It's really toxic and breaks your concentration repeatedly. 
  - Maybe have a user filter that would selectively mute videos by default or makes you wait a minute to check a tweet/post

### Project Y: Youtube enhancements
- State: In planning/research phase
  - See above. Not much to add at this point. I turned the autoplay off in the setting and it still does it when I hover over it. I am not sure what bothers me more, am I in the wrong state or is the app usability toxic by default? Sometimes I wake up and don't want quick moving videos shoved down my eyes, as well as intrusive thumbnails and I really hate first-second sound attack every time on some channels.

### Project G: Google enhancements
- State: Planning/research phase
  - We will start wih making every search verbatim and search by default on the past few months. This will filter out a lot of the cr*p that google serves up to us normally. No offense but Google has gotten less and less reliable for me and I am tired of not being able to find anything and being offered all sorts of paid sites which are completely unrelated in reality to my search query. 
  - We will probably have to involve some kind of AI to find what we want but as a starter, just having a button or shortcut combo to search "verbatim past year/past month" will make things a lot better by itself.

## Letterless projects

### Collection of AI assisted features
AI voice mail, but for text conversations
- Essentially what github copilot does, but for text messaging. Reads convos, gives suggestions on replies. Could be hugely useful for repeated phrases or just to convey something that you can't find the words for. Would be good to reduce mental load.

AI assistant that can schedule meetings, write emails, etc.
- We have to see what Google's Duet AI is capable of, but essentially my assistant would be a more practical version of ChatGPT. An AI that can actually do things for you. ChatGPT can understand you very well, be it text, or voice input, it just needs some kind of an active component that can do things like what I said above.

AI assistant that can represent you on meetings, talk/chat for you.
- How many times did we dream about this? Delegating an AI to go and impersonate you or represent you might be on the wilder end, but in general, this would be extremely useful if you are sick, or have to be in 2 places at once. The AI would respond based on your input, and collect the meeting's chat and listen in to what people are talking about and summarise it for you after the meeting.
