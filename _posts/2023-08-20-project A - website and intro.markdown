First project - Portfolio website!

It seemed fitting to make the first real post about making this website.

How did we get here?

Well I recognised that I need to prove 2 things to myself and everyone else: My knowledge and my ability to learn new skills.

This is due to a few things. Firstly, perhaps not having 'enough' certificates displayed on my LinkedIn page. While I can write a cool CV and update my various profiles, it lacks any real bearing. Basically I have to rely on my work history and although it's the biggest thing, it's not everything.

Secondly, this is a way for me to get busy and productive, while actually broadening my knowledge and getting a more complete picture. For example a recurring quality that now frequently comes up is the ability to design and implement QA frameworks from scratch, and as much as it pains me to say it, it's something I need to work on and what better to than actually doing it.

Thirdly, I'm essentially working on marketing myself better, and maintaining an online presence; which are essential in today's world of omnipresent social media. Especially within industries like Software and Technology it's important to be able to present yourself professionally, when the first thing people will do is to google you and your work.

And lastly, as said above it's also to prove myself, and everyone else that I can do it. Some days it's extra difficult, being neurodiverse and all. I consider myself fortunate that I can do this kind of work and will continue regardless of the struggles.

I believe Software and Technology has the power to improve the lives of many; it's about seeing problems and solving them; it's about actively creating new fields and solutions, and making things easier through automation, and benefiting communities around the world.

If that sounded a tad too reflective for a web intro, it's my passion for tech paired with a desire to making our world brighter, one endeavor at a time.
